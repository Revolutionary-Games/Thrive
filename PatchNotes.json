  "0.6.0.0": "## Patch Notes\r\n- Added day/night cycle. Note that due to missing tutorials, balancing etc. which we didn\u0027t have time for, you need to manually enable this feature when starting a new game in the advanced options.\r\n- Added the first few pages of the Thriveopedia to show info about the current game and show the evolutionary tree now in the game proper as well\r\n- Added fossilisation feature to save selected species to the museum which can be loaded through the Thriveopedia to the freebuild editor\r\n- Pilus damage now has a cooldown to prevent a ton of damage from it very quickly\r\n- Balancing changes\r\n- Fixed infinite compound ejection caused by negative compound ejection (only a bandaid fix for now due to time constraints)\r\n- Engulfing now gives extra glucose on top of what the engulfed cell actually had\r\n- Membrane colour transparency works again. Be prepared to have AI species evolve to be more transparent again to avoid being eaten by the player.\r\n- Refactored our code related to species colour adjusting when used in graphs\r\n- Fixed multiple issues related to organelle graphics rendering by changing their render modes and splitting organelles into transparent and opaque ones\r\n- New intro video\r\n- Added our social media and website links to the main menu\r\n- Added safe mode start up after Thrive crashed before managing to start fully.

  "0.5.8.1": "## Patch Notes\r\n- Fixed major problem with the spawn system not being able to despawn things as fast as it spawned. This should give a major improvement to later game performance\r\n- Improved game object processing speed and added some multithreaded processing to them\r\n- Fixed crashing in text formatting when using our localized text class to guard against bad translations\r\n- Fixed incorrect translation bbcode being able to crash the game\r\n- Updated to Godot 3.4.4\r\n- Switched to a different Steam client library to make the Steam build work on Windows 7\r\n- New mod loader improvements to have inbuilt Harmony support\r\n- Fixed enemy spawn cheat not making the spawned cells despawn\r\n- Fixed auto-evo using energy balance instead of consumption when calculating populations\r\n- Reduced flagellum energy cost to 4\r\n- Fixed unintended cannibalism when player becomes multicellular\r\n- Fixed an issue with the player species not spawning in multicellular\r\n- Fixed dead cells being able to be added to a colony causing issues\r\n- Fixed bacteria group spawns spawning things that immediately despawn\r\n- Added  a new more detailed metrics panel (default key is shift\u002BF3) to be able to see game performance in more detail\r\n- Microbe editor now shows the total storage of a cell\r\n- Added a new microbe stage ambiance track\r\n- The options menu now shows the resolution the game renders at \r\n- Main menu music now fades out when starting a new game instead of cutting out immediately\r\n- Fixed patch map nodes reacting to the scroll wheel\r\n- Partially fixed NaN compound storage amounts by resetting them to 0\r\n- Fixed incorrect \u0022{0}\u0022 shown in save upgrade fail message\r\n- Fixed our custom colour picker leaking Godot objects\r\n- Simplified logic slightly in name permutation generation\r\n- Romanian language is now available in the game\r\n- Updated translations",

To access you need to be in a big enough cell colony (and not using freebuild mode). This prototype includes some new music tracks meant for the multicellular stage.\r\n- Patch names are now procedurally generated. No longer will you always have to explore Pangonia\r\n- Colony members now affect how fast a colony can move, their mass now has a slowing effect but their flagella will help the colony move \r\n- Being in a colony now gives an osmoregulation discount based on how many cells there are in the colony\r\n- Increased compound cloud brightness in brighter biomes to make them much easier to see\r\n- Added buttons to the abilities hot bar for unbinding and signaling agents (signaling button for now requires you to hold down the associated *key* to use)\r\n- AI now knows how to use the chemoreceptor\r\n- Sessile species should no longer be able to get stuck in engulf mode in the AI\r\n- New model and icon for the chemoreceptor\r\n- Generated membranes are now cached to reduce lag spikes also slightly made the membrane generation algorithm faster as well\r\n- Cell corpse chunks are now added to be counted in entity limit which seems to help a bit with performance\r\n- Increased entity limit considering the recent performance improvements. It\u0027s also no longer save file specific so older saves will also use the new limit now. The entity limit no longer considers colony members as separate entities.\r\n- Taking damage due to being out of ATP now has a specific sound for it\r\n- Auto-evo now takes environmental compound availability into account when calculating fitness\r\n- Balance tweaks, includes adjustments to organelle costs\r\n- AI will now stop moving if it is out of ATP and wait to recharge\r\n- Brought back the accidentally deleted win screen background\r\n- Binding mode sound now fades in and out better\r\n- Loading screen tips are now formatted properly and also parse bbcode instead of displaying the raw markup\r\n- Chemoreceptor colour is now automatically selected to match the compound colour in the modify GUI\r\n- Clicking outside the species name box now tries to accept the new name and flashing the box if the name is invalid\r\n- Extinction music now starts earlier to sync up more dramatically with the appearing extinction text\r\n- Tweaked the wording of most of the tutorials\r\n- Made the tutorial highlight background darker to make tutorials pointing to GUI elements more obvious\r\n- Switched chemoreceptor to use a different algorithm based on rays around the cell to find compound positions\r\n- Added a command line flag (to be used with a new launcher version) that disables all videos as one player had a problem with the intro video crashing their game\r\n- Disabled the X button on the organelle modify popup as that seemed a bit too error-prone to a player\r\n- Saving will now detect if the save name is too long or invalid and give an error instead of silently failing to write the save to disk\r\n- Charts will no longer show \u0022x\u0022 or \u0022y\u0022 incorrectly when they weren\u0027t supposed to\r\n- Added some code to the binding process that tries to detect disposed cells earlier, hopefully improves sometimes buggy binding\r\n- Added a way for Godot objects to skip queued method invocations without any warning messages that were previously quite prevalent from bbcode in the editor\r\n- Implemented custom logic to workaround Godot colour picker pick from game window having a (potentially crashing) bug\r\n- Improved theming for file dialog\r\n- Removed duplicate phosphate icon file\r\n- Disabled resizing the editor report tab panels as that could break the text layout\r\n- Moved to using a new C# feature (nullable references)\r\n- Changed style instructions to prefer targeted new (C# feature)\r\n- Removed our custom PathUtils class that is no longer needed as C# has a builtin path combine method\r\n- Updated our styleguide and tweaked automatic code checks\r\n- Translations file updating script now fixes trailing whitespace which can appear on Windows\r\n- Translations now use no line wrapping, this time unnecessary changes caused by that with Weblate disagreeing with gettext seem to be finally fixed\r\n- Updated translations",
  "0.5.7.0": "## Patch Notes\r\n- Added chemoreceptor organelle which shows lines towards detected compounds. Note: old saves are compatible but the chemoreceptor won\u0027t work until you die and respawn if you loaded an older save.\r\n- Implemented the organelle modify menu. For now only used for the chemoreceptor\r\n- Implemented the timeline tab in the editor showing world or patch related events that have happened in the game world\r\n- Updated to Godot 3.4.2. We are using a custom Godot build as our [Breakpad code](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56014) was not merged yet.\r\n- Reduced max entity count a lot again. This should make it so that extremely low performance of the game doesn\u0027t happen anymore. We are still investigating the performance issues and will increase the game entity counts again once we have addressed the part of the game that is actually too slow.\r\n- Added a crash dumping system back to the game. Combined with the latest launcher version this allows reporting the crashes to us developers to view on [ThriveDevCenter](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/ThriveDevCenter) Note that the crash reporting is not implemented for mac, yet.\r\n- Fixed the choppy intro video playback in the previous release caused by Godot removing optimized webm playback on Windows\r\n- Fixed flagella animations not working after update to Godot 3.4\r\n- The report tab of the editor now has a patch selector drop down that allows changing patches on that screen to easily view the graphs for other patches\r\n- Player species is now always printed first in auto-evo results and other species are in alphabetical order\r\n- Added a button on graphs to show the graph in bigger size to more easily see what the graph shows\r\n- Adjusted microbe movement sound\r\n- Added a separate ice damage sound instead of using the general damage sound for them\r\n- Double clicking a save now loads it or asks to overwrite it if double clicked in the create save menu\r\n- A few more tutorials are now forced (the close button for them has been disabled)\r\n- Cell speed calculation has been improved regarding flagella that don\u0027t point backwards. Now speed is calculated along the direction the player\u0027s cell can move the fastest in, which is not necessarily forwards.\r\n- Movement ATP drain was also updated with the above change, and now it also only considers flagella that can push in the maximum movement force direction. So no longer do forward facing flagella show up in editor as costing ATP when in fact they can\u0027t operate at the same time as backwards facing flagella.\r\n- Added scientific flavour text for the pilus\r\n- Disabled multithreaded rendering option which seemed to cause rare issues while not helping at all in normal use\r\n- Improved look and tooltip positioning for the editor sliders\r\n- Added a sound effect for when cells collide hard enough\r\n- Increased the fade duration when changing music tracks\r\n- Remade the trash icon as higher resolution and added a pressed state for the trash buttons\r\n- Graphs now group extinct species separately\r\n- Tweaked the visuals of the toxin particle effect\r\n- Tweaked the patch name display fade animation\r\n- Reduced small iron chunk mass so that they are easier to push around than the big chunks\r\n- Fixed external effects on extinct species causing errors\r\n- Fixed graphs using 32-bit integers to hold data, which caused the graphs to not display correctly when species populations got too high\r\n- Fixed tutorial boxes being on top of the pause menu in terms of mouse clicks\r\n- Fixed dialog resizing sometimes expanding them in the wrong direction\r\n- Fixed pause menu, win and lose screens not resizing when the game window is resized\r\n- Fixed a bug in our hybrid 3D audio player class not actually behaving spatially\r\n- Fixed the widths of a few organelle tooltip titles\r\n- Fixed refresh button in mod manager sometimes causing duplicate mod entries to appear\r\n- Fixed really long save names causing GUI layout problems by enabling text wrapping for them\r\n- Fixed pressing ESC in the game over load menu not closing the right thing\r\n- Fixed folders ending in \u0022.thrivesave\u0022 being detected as save files and causing problems\r\n- Fixed the randomize species name button not being the same height as the text box it was next to\r\n- Fixed some scenes (that are intended to be used like this) not being able to be started directly from the Godot editor due to resource loading order\r\n- Disabled mouse wheel scroll on colour picker bars as they are usually within a scroll container causing issues depending on mouse positioning when scrolling\r\n- Auto-evo prediction runs are now cancelled earlier to try to avoid error prints regarding them failing due to the player editing their species again before the run finished\r\n- Reduced the volume of microbe-theme-7 to be more inline with other music\r\n- Slight source code cleanup by moving the food source classes to the namespace they should have been in\r\n- Updated our CI checking tools\r\n- Improvements to our build scripts\r\n- Updated translations",

  "0.3.4.0": "Thrive 0.3.4 is here! Though a comparatively small release from a gameplay perspective, it represents a tonne of programming work on behind-the-scenes functionality and improved stability. It comes with a shiny new launcher to boot. Almost all these features are credited to hhyyrylainen and crodnu, two of our programmers.\r\n\r\n**In this release**\r\n\r\n- New Lua library. General performance improvements thanks to a restructured scripting system, fixing plenty of common crashes in the process. The console FPS counter is also fixed.\r\n- A long standing bug that has caused some people to crash when they complete the tutorial has now been fixed (at least, it\u0027s fixed for those who\u0027ve tested the release candidates).\r\n- Loading saves should now cause fewer crashes due to audio errors.\r\n- Overhaul of the microbial process system. Now, instead of draining ATP immediately, your cell will act smarter when allocating compounds towards different tasks and converting between them. This gives greater utility to the compound bars introduced in the previous release.\r\n- Microbes drop a percentage of the compounds that compose their organelles on death.\r\n- Different chance to generate each organelle in procedurally generated and mutated microbes (which means, among other things, less toxic vacuoles).\r\n- Adjusted compound cloud densities to make the game easier. This area is still completely unbalanced, so it may not be much easier, but still.\r\n\r\n**Controls**\r\n\r\n* Point mouse to turn\r\n* WASD to move around\r\n* Mouse scroll wheel (or \u002B/- keys) to zoom\r\n* E to release toxins (if you have any)\r\n* G to engulf other cells (you must be bigger in size)\r\n* ESC to bring up menu.\r\n* F2 to switch between microbe stage and microbe editor\r\n* F4 to save game\r\n* F10 to load previously saved game\r\n* ESC to save a genus name change\r\n\r\n**Launcher**\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obvious addition is the new Thrive launcher. If you don\u0027t already have it, download [here](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher/releases). The launcher checks for new Thrive versions whenever it runs, running through the tedious and confusing downloading and unpacking tasks for you. It comes with handy feeds of new development forum posts and website updates, and future updates should give it greater utility.\r\n\r\n**Devblog**\r\n\r\nAs ever, we have a [Devblog](http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-12-prepare-for-launch) explaining the release in more detail, including the extended functionality of the Thrive launcher. Check it out for the latest general news in the Thrive universe too.\r\n\r\n**Trailer**\r\n\r\nWe decided to do something a little different for this release\u0027s [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkcfEeZn0cY). Instead of some scenic shots of the game accompanied by thematic music, we used scenic shots of the game accompanied by thematic music AND a voiceover from developer MontySpud (with thanks to Naggorath for script assistance and video editing).\r\n\r\n**Engine changes**\r\n\r\n~~We\u0027re considering switching engine to the open-source Unreal Engine 4. You can read more about this in our Devblog. Here we\u0027ll leave only a link to the [testing thread](http://thrivegame.freeforums.net/thread/1415/thrive-engine-switch-unreal-tech). We need as many people as possible to test the compatibility of this new version. If a future release using UE4 has errors on your machine, we\u0027ll gladly help fix them, but feel silently annoyed that you didn\u0027t test it out and tell us sooner.~~",
  "0.3.3.0": "We might have missed the planned Christmas release date (and then the replanned New Years one), but we are finally here with Thrive version 0.3.3. It features a ton of frequently requested features, such as the reproduction and health systems and auto evo. Due to changes on the backend, we have also expanded our support for more players out there. \r\n\r\nLastly, I\u0027d like to publicly acknowledge crodnu, our newest programmer, who\u0027s responsible for nearly half of the features listed below.\r\n\r\n**In this release:**\r\n- This release features a new GUI. We\u0027ve been working on it for the last couple of month and it looks absolutely amazing. Many of the unnecessarily clunky elements have been removed to create a minimalistic and intuitive GUI. It is still a work in progress with some of the buttons not working, but it is a base that we will be able to expand on for the next releases.\r\n- Mass\u2014Previously, large cells weighed the same as smaller ones. Now, each hex has a given mass, and as a result, larger cells move slower and need more flagella to propel them.\r\n- Auto Evo\u0027s primitive cousin: Random Evo. The tide pool is now filled with new creatures that will try to kill you with agents and phagocytosis and will mutate every time you exit the editor. Currently, there is no intelligence behind their decisions, so it\u0027s easy to get abominations of nature, but it\u0027s a step in the right direction.\r\n- Reproduction System. Reproductase, a fictional compound and one of the main critiques we have about the cell stage, is finally gone! To reproduce you need to divide each of your organelles into two and then duplicate the DNA in your nucleus. Each organelle currently needs 2 glucose and 1 amino acids (made from 1 glucose and 1 ammonia) to split in half. In other words, make sure your glucose (white clouds) store is always above 16 and your ammonia (yellow clouds) store is above 12 and you\u0027ll be fine.\r\n- Health System\u2014you can now replenish lost health by getting amino acids and glucose. Damaged organelles will shrink and healthy organelles will grow.\r\n- AMD graphics card support. We changed all of our shaders to glsl, so all those of you who don\u0027t have NVidia cards can finally enjoy the game\u0027s graphics. This broke some features (such as membrane tinting) that we couldn\u0027t fix for this release, but glsl shaders will allow us to create much better graphics in the future.\r\n- Minor changes in compound availability between biomes.\r\n- Linux is now simpler to set up.\r\n- We\u0027re aware of occasional random crashes. We\u0027re not sure what\u0027s causing them and they appear fairly infrequently. If you have one, take a screenshot of the console and send it our way so we can work on fixing them for next release.\r\n\r\n**Controls:**\r\n- Point mouse to turn\r\n- WASD to move around\r\n- Mouse scroll wheel (or \u002B/- keys) to zoom\r\n- E to release toxins (if you have any)\r\n- G to engulf other cells (you must be bigger in size)\r\n- ESC to bring up menu.\r\n- F2 to switch between microbe stage and microbe editor\r\n- F4 to save game\r\n- F10 to load previously saved game\r\n- ESC to save a genus name change\r\n\r\n**Devblog:**\r\n\r\nClick [here](http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-11-new-thrive-new-year/) to read a more in-depth devblog about this release. It talks about everything we\u0027ve been working on, as well as other unrelated stuff.\r\n\r\n**Trailer:**\r\n\r\nAs usual, we also have a [trailer](https://youtu.be/xBKoAYqriQA) showing off some of the new features. If your version of the game has a significant graphical difference to this, it\u0027s a bug so you should notify us by posting [here](http://thrivegame.freeforums.net/board/19/bug-reports).\r\n\r\n**Future:**\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3.4 will focus on fixing many bugs and ironing out current game play. We will add a freebuild editor (unlimited mutation points) and allow you to change your membrane color. However, the main feature will be moving much of the lua code to C\u002B\u002B. This will reduce lag and prepare everything for agents and a CPA system in 0.4.0 and beyond. A second focus will be to fix the process system, which doesn\u0027t work as quick and isn\u0027t as robust as it should be (which you will probably notice while trying to reproduce).",
  "0.3.2.0": "Finally, the awaited end-of-summer release is here! It\u0027s a couple months after the beta that was released back in March, but we managed to squish in a bunch of new features since then and fix 12 game breaking bugs, some of which were here since pre-0.2.3. That means you should have very smooth gameplay with relatively few crashes compared to the old versions. But don\u0027t forget to save often (I spent over a week fixing that functionality)!\n\n**In this release:**\n- Compound Clouds! Enjoy the fluid compounds as they drift through the currents instead of the ancient, discrete particle emitters\n- Continued Linux Support\u2014Ubuntu, Arch, and Fedora should all work\n- Colored Organelles\u2014organelle materials are now tinted to be the same color as the membranes\n- Damage Indicator\u2014the membrane and all organelles now flash red when you take damage\n- Process System\u2014no longer spend hours trying to get 5 reproductase to reproduce only to have your cell get rid of it once vacuole storage are full!\n- Engulfment Indicator\u2014the membrane flashes blue when you engulf another cell (or another cell engulfs you)\n- New biomes\u2014whenever you die, you will be randomly placed into one of 5 new biomes. Discover them all!\n- Endosymbiosis\u2014engulf free-floating chloroplasts and toxin vacuoles repeatedly until you manage to assimilate them and use them for yourself\n- Gameplay Tuning\u2014less MP in the editor, better steering, less ATP consumed, and others...\n- A bunch of bug fixes\u2014most importantly, the save/load button actually works this time, and won\u0027t crash the game on you!\n\n**Controls:**\n- Point mouse to turn\n- WASD to move around\n- Mouse scroll wheel (or \u002B/- keys) to zoom\n- E to release toxins (if you have any)\n- G to engulf other cells (you must be bigger in size)\n- ESC to bring up menu.\n- F2 to switch between microbe stage and microbe editor\n- F4 to save your current gamestate\n- F10 to load your previous saved gamestate\n- F12 to save a name-change\n- Symmetry button between undo and redo in editor\n\n**Devblog:**\n\nClick [here](http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-9-current-affairs/) to read a more in-depth devblog about this release.

  "0.3.1.0": "A couple months after the release of 0.3.0, we are proud to announce the newest version of Thrive: 0.3.1.

  "0.3.0.0": "Almost a year since our last release, and a month since the first release candidate, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-3-farewell-hexagons/\u0022\u003Ewe finally bring you the awaited version 0.3.0.\u003C/a\u003E\n\n**In this release:**\n- Upgrade to Ogre version 2.0\n- Brand new opening cutscene (and video support, in general)\n- Cell Membrane (no more honeycombs!)\n- Organelle models\n- Organelles take up multiple hexes and can be rotated\n- Microbe editor revamp: green highlight if you can place an organelle and red if you cannot\n- Organelles can only be placed next to existing ones\n- Compound storage should be slightly less worse (still not ideal, though)\n- Tooltips\n\n**Controls:**\n- Point mouse to turn\n- WASD to move around\n- Mouse scroll wheel to zoom\n- E to release toxins (if you have any)\n- G to engulf other cells (you must be bigger in size)\n- ESC to bring up menu.\n- F2 to switch between microbe stage and microbe editor\n- F4 to save your current gamestate\n- F10 to load your previous saved gamestate\n- F12 to save a name-change\n- (Cheat: if you ever get frustrated by reproductase, just press \u2018p\u2019)\n\n**Future plans:**\n\nThis graphics update has made Thrive look a lot better than before, but we still have a long way to go. The main goal for next release, 0.3.1, is compound clouds and fluid dynamics and to get a working linux build. We are hoping to release sometime this year unless something unexpected comes up\u2026 which most likely will. We have already implemented different microbe coloration (you can change every single cell\u2019s color by going into the Membrane.material file), but we are currently lacking a GUI for doing this. Speaking of which, we currently have a couple people working on designing a better GUI.\n\nFor the remaining 0.3.x releases, we want to implement bacteria, a moving background, an options menu, and a couple other minor things (see [the dev forum](http://forum.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/t/post-0-3-0-plans/129) for in-depth information on the upcoming features). Although this hasn\u2019t been discussed much and is completely my opinion, I think that 0.4.0 will be the release where we implement agents, toxins, and in-depth combat gameplay. This should make Thrive an actual fun game that you can actually play (it\u2019s more of a simulation currently). 0.5.x will probably be the release with an in-depth AI, and 0.6.x will feature compounds, population dynamics, and auto-evo and will basically conclude the cell stage. Again, this is just my speculation on what could happen.\n\nTo finish everything off, [here is a series of images](http://imgur.com/a/MfBM0) of Thrive evolving through the years.\n",
  "0.2.4.0": "Another half-year, another release! And this one brings you the long-awaited GUI update, which we kept promising soon while we were too busy to work on it! But it is done! And so we release! Yay!\n\nNote, the linux release this time is on [mega](https://mega.co.nz/#!k1JjibaB!NNSSUoK9I0UhVz4h5u0GeU4RtM-P63Vvqdi5pxaLRLg), thanks to issues uploading to GitHub.\n\n##### New Features\n- All the features from the previous release\n- A super-awesome new GUI! Yay!\n- New microbes, new behaviours! \n  - Some microbes are now toxic, so be careful who you kill!\n  - Others will hunt you down and shoot at you. Choose your battles wisely.\n- Revamped reproduction! Swim, eat, metabolize, reproduce!\n- Sound effects for everything, from button-clicking to microbe death!\n- New compound models, for ammonia, amino acids, and reproductase!\n- An arrow in the editor so people will remember which way is forward!\n- Name your species! Click on your species name in the editor, write something, then hit F12!\n- Thanks to the pre-release, we have fixed a whole lotta bugs!\n\n##### Controls\n- Point mouse to turn\n- WASD to move around\n- Mouse scrollwheel to zoom\n- E to release toxins (if you have any)\n- ESC to bring up menu.\n- F1 to toggle alternate reality (Debugging feature)\n- \u0060 to bring up console (Debugging feature)\n- F2 to switch between microbe stage and microbe editor\n- F4 to save your current gamestate\n- F10 to load your previous saved gamestate\n- F12 to save a name-change\n\n##### Known Issues\n- The save button in the editor to save your creation is working, but the load button does nothing. Instead you can open the console with \u0027\u0060\u0027 (the key left of 1) and enter: loadMicrobe(\u0022MyMicrobeName\u0022) and hit the enter key\n- For other less major things, go see our [Issue List](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/issues).\n"
