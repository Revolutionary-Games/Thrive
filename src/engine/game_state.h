/**
* @brief Represents a distinct set of active systems and entities
*
* The game has to switch between different states. Examples of a state are
* "main menu", "microbe gameplay" or "microbe editor". These states usually
* share very few entities and even fewer systems, so it is sensible to
* separate them completely (and, if necessary, share data over other channels).
*
* Each GameState has its own EntityManager and its own set of systems. Game
* states are identified by their name, a unique string.
*
* GameStates cannot be created directly. Use Engine::createGameState to create
* new GameStates.
