 *  - <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MeganFox/20101208/88590/Game_Engines_101_The_EntityComponent_Model.php">Game Engines 101: The Entity / Component Model</a>
 *  - <a href="http://www.richardlord.net/blog/what-is-an-entity-framework">What is an entity system framework?</a>
 *
 * The following gives an overview of the implementation of entities, 
 * components and systems in Thrive.
 *
 * @section entity_manager Entity Manager
 *
 * Entities and their components are managed by an EntityManager. The
 * EntityManager identifies each entity by its unique id. You can use
 * either EntityManager::generateNewId() or EntityManager::getNamedId()
 * to obtain an id.
 *
 * An entity can at most one component of each type. Component types are
 * distinguished primarily by their <em>component id</em> (see also 
 * Component::generateTypeId()). This component id is generated dynamically
 * at application startup and may change between executions. To identify a
 * component type across executions, use the <em>component name</em>, which
 * should be constant between executions. To convert between component id
 * and component name, use ComponentFactory::typeNameToId() and 
 * ComponentFactory::typeIdToName().
 *
 * For convenience, there's an Entity class that wraps the API of 
 * EntityManager in an entity-centric way.
 *
 * @section system Systems
 *
 * The absolute minimum a system has to implement is the System::update()
 * function. You can also override System::init() and System::shutdown() for
 * setup and teardown procedures.
 *
 * Usually, a system operates on entities that have a specific combination of
 * components. The EntityFilter template can filter out entities that have
 * such a component makeup.
 *
 * @section engine Engine
 *
 * Systems are managed by Engines. Each engine runs in its own thread and is 
 * responsible for specific part of the game. At the time of this writing,
 * there are the OgreEngine for rendering graphics and the ScriptEngine for
 * interfacing to Lua.
 *
 * All engines share the same EntityManager. When a component is added or 
 * removed from the EntityManager, the engines are notified. The changes are
 * applied at the beginning of the engine's next frame. This way, an the 
 * engine's systems can safely iterate over the components without one 
 * component suddenly being destroyed by another thread.
 *
 *
