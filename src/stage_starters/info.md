Stage Starters Folder
=====================

This folder has scene files that directly start specific stages of the
game. These are super useful for starting through the Godot editor or
a debugger to get to a stage very fast you want to debug.

Many of the creature stages share the same primary scene files so
these helper scenes are needed. Just for completeness other stages
also have starters here but they just load the relevant scene for that
stage without anything extra.
