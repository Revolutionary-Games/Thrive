Linking Thrive libraries statically or dynamically with other modules,
or loading extra modules into Thrive, is making a combined work based
on the Thrive libraries. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Thrive give you
permission to link the Thrive libraries with independent modules meant
to be loaded dynamically into a running Thrive process to modify or
extend the program (create game modifications, also known as mods)
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
copy and distribute these independent modules under terms of your
choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent
module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An
independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on
Thrive source code, except if only interface method signatures are
copied for the purpose of creating new implementations of those
interfaces.

If you modify Thrive, you may extend this exception to your version of
Thrive, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
delete this exception statement from your version.
