It features a ton of frequently requested features, such as the reproduction and health systems and auto evo. Due to changes on the backend, we have also expanded our support for more players out there.","PatchNotes":["This release features a new GUI. We\u0027ve been working on it for the last couple of month and it looks absolutely amazing. Many of the unnecessarily clunky elements have been removed to create a minimalistic and intuitive GUI. It is still a work in progress with some of the buttons not working, but it is a base that we will be able to expand on for the next releases.","Mass\u2014Previously, large cells weighed the same as smaller ones. Now, each hex has a given mass, and as a result, larger cells move slower and need more flagella to propel them.","Auto Evo\u0027s primitive cousin: Random Evo. The tide pool is now filled with new creatures that will try to kill you with agents and phagocytosis and will mutate every time you exit the editor. Currently, there is no intelligence behind their decisions, so it\u0027s easy to get abominations of nature, but it\u0027s a step in the right direction.","Reproduction System. Reproductase, a fictional compound and one of the main critiques we have about the cell stage, is finally gone! To reproduce you need to divide each of your organelles into two and then duplicate the DNA in your nucleus. Each organelle currently needs 2 glucose and 1 amino acids (made from 1 glucose and 1 ammonia) to split in half. In other words, make sure your glucose (white clouds) store is always above 16 and your ammonia (yellow clouds) store is above 12 and you\u0027ll be fine.","Health System\u2014you can now replenish lost health by getting amino acids and glucose. Damaged organelles will shrink and healthy organelles will grow.","AMD graphics card support. We changed all of our shaders to glsl, so all those of you who don\u0027t have NVidia cards can finally enjoy the game\u0027s graphics. This broke some features (such as membrane tinting) that we couldn\u0027t fix for this release, but glsl shaders will allow us to create much better graphics in the future.","Minor changes in compound availability between biomes.","Linux is now simpler to set up.","We\u0027re aware of occasional random crashes.

General performance improvements thanks to a restructured scripting system, fixing plenty of common crashes in the process. The console FPS counter is also fixed.","A long standing bug that has caused some people to crash when they complete the tutorial has now been fixed (at least, it\u0027s fixed for those who\u0027ve tested the release candidates).","Loading saves should now cause fewer crashes due to audio errors.","Overhaul of the microbial process system. Now, instead of draining ATP immediately, your cell will act smarter when allocating compounds towards different tasks and converting between them. This gives greater utility to the compound bars introduced in the previous release.","Microbes drop a percentage of the compounds that compose their organelles on death.","Different chance to generate each organelle in procedurally generated and mutated microbes (which means, among other things, less toxic vacuoles).","Adjusted compound cloud densities to make the game easier.

We\u0027ve decided to call it 0.6.0 to close off a really productive year and set the stage for the [roadmap](https://wiki.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/wiki/Release_Roadmap) to start being completed next year. The biggest features this time are the Thriveopedia and the day/night cycle (this needs to be enabled when starting a new game as we didn\u0027t have time to fully polish the feature). The patch notes are shorter this time than usual because a lot of time was spent on the new [Launcher 2.0](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher/releases/tag/v2.0.0), which was released recently.","PatchNotes":["Added day/night cycle. Note that due to missing tutorials, balancing etc. which we didn\u0027t have time for, you need to manually enable this feature when starting a new game in the advanced options.","Added the first few pages of the Thriveopedia to show info about the current game and show the evolutionary tree now in the game proper as well","Added fossilisation feature to save selected species to the museum which can be loaded through the Thriveopedia to the freebuild editor","Pilus damage now has a cooldown to prevent a ton of damage from it very quickly","Balancing changes","Fixed infinite compound ejection caused by negative compound ejection (only a bandaid fix for now due to time constraints)","Engulfing now gives extra glucose on top of what the engulfed cell actually had","Membrane colour transparency works again.
