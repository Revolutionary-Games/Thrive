        "Fun Fact, The Didinium and Paramecium are a textbook example of a predator prey relationship that has been studied for decades, now are you the Didinium, or the Paramecium? Predator, or Prey?",
        "Here's a tip, toxins can be used to knock other toxins away from you if you are quick enough.",
        "Here's a tip, Osmoregulation costs 1 ATP per second per hex your cell has, each empty hex of cytoplasm generates 5 ATP per second aswell, which means if you are losing ATP due to osmoregulation just add a couple empty hexes cytoplasm or remove some organelles.",
        "Fun Fact, In real life prokaryotes have something called Biocompartments which act like organelles, and are in fact called Polyhedral organelles",
        "Fun Fact, The metabolosome is what is called a Polyhedral organelle",
        "Here's a tip, sometimes its best just to run away from other cells.",
        "Here's a tip, if a cell is about half your size, thats when you can engulf them.",
        "Here's a tip, Bacteria can be stronger then they appear, they may look small, but some of them can burrow into you and kill you that way!",
        "Here's a tip, You can hunt other species to extinction if you arent careful enough, they can also be hunted to extinction by other species.",
        "WIGGLY THINGS!!",
        "Smeltal the meltal.",
        "Those blue cells though.",
        "Here's a tip, Biomes are more than just different backgrounds, the compounds in different biomes sometimes spawn at different rates.",
        "Here's a tip, The more flagella you have, the faster you go, vroom vroom, but it also costs more ATP",
        "Here's a tip, you can en[g]ulf chunks iron or otherwise.",
        "Here's a tip, prepare before adding a nucleus. those things are expensive! In upkeep and up front cost.",
        "Fun Fact, Did you know that there are over 8000 species of ciliate on planet earth?",
        "Fun Fact, The Stentor is a ciliate that can stretch itself and catch prey in a kind of trumpet like mouth that draws prey in by generating water currents with cilia.",
        "Fun Fact, The Didinum is a ciliate that hunts paramecia.",
        "Fun Fact, The Ameoba hunts and catches prey with 'legs' made of cytoplasm called pseudopods, eventually we want those in Thrive.",
        "Here's a tip, Watch out for larger cells and large bacteria, it's not fun to be digested, and they will eat you.",
        "Here's a tip, Osmoregulation costs 1 ATP per second per hex, each empty hex of cytoplasm generates 5 ATP per second aswell, which means if you are losing ATP due to osmoregulation just add a couple empty hexes cytoplasm or remove some organelles",
        "Here's a tip, if your cell is 150 hexes, you can engulf the large iron chunks.",
        "Thrive is meant as a simulation of an alien planet, therefore it makes sense that most creatures you find will be related to one or two other species due to evolution happening around you, see if you can identify them!",
        "Fun Fact, The Thrive team does podcasts every so often, you should check them out!",
        "Fun Fact, Thrive is meant as a simulation of an alien planet, therefore it makes sense that most creatures you find will be related to one or two other species due to evolution happening around you, see if you can identify them!",
        "Fun Fact, One of the first playable game-play prototypes was made by our awesome programmer, untrustedlife!"
