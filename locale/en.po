For each food source, it is shown much energy the species gains from it. Additionally the total energy that is available from that source is shown.

This process, called [b]iron respiration[/b], releases energy which the cell can then harvest. It does, however, require [thrive:compound type=\"carbondioxide\"][/thrive:compound] and [thrive:compound type=\"oxygen\"][/thrive:compound] to function, and lower levels of either of these in the environment will slow down the rate of its [thrive:compound type=\"atp\"][/thrive:compound] production."

This allows their new membrane bound organelles to be much more complex, efficient, and specialized than if they were free-floating in the cytoplasm.

"Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryote organelles do not have membranes. Instead, prokaryotes like bacteria construct compartments out of proteins. A [b]Metabolosome[/b] is an example of such a compartment, officially referred to as a Bacterial MicroCompartment (BMC). BMCs consist of a polyhedral protein shell around 100-200 nm in size that looks similar to a virus capsid. The proteins that make up the shell typically have (semi-permeable) pores that allow different compounds (substrates and products) in and out of the organelle. They concentrate enzymes and proteins involved in specific metabolic processes in one spot, ensuring their success. The protein shell also acts as a physical barrier, allowing BMCs to conduct metabolic reactions that create toxic or unstable intermediate compounds.\n"
