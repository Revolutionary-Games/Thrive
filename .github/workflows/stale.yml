            Stale action thinks that this is inactive, this shouldn't happen
            for issues...

          stale-pr-message: |
            This PR has been inactive for a while and as such is being marked
            stale. This PR will be automatically closed if this stays stale
            for a while.

            If this is still being worked on / will probably resume work at
            some point please feel free to continue working on this and reopen
            this in case this was already automatically closed.

          close-pr-message: |
            This PR is being automatically closed due to being stale. Please
            only reopen this if work is actually resuming on this PR. We have
            automatic PR closing to make sure that PRs that never get finished
            aren't forever hanging out in the list of open PRs.
