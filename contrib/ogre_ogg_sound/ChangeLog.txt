		* Potential crash
		
	* Fixed bug detailed here: http://www.ogre3d.org/addonforums/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=29880

	* Fixed crash when unloading/reloading OgreOggSound plugin

* Version 1.21

	* Tweaked sound fading

	* Finished off optional (execute command now) flag for MULTI-THREADED mode, allows user to specify per-sound immediate (blocking) execution of some common sound actions,
		* Play / Stop / Pause / create

	* Bug fix - EOF flag wasn't being reset correctly stopping stream sounds being replayed after finished playing.

	* Added openal path for EFX-Util lib on windows


* Version 1.2

	* Licensed under the MIT licensing terms.

	* Bug fix - playtime incorrectly calculated for WAV sounds

	* Bug fix - streamed sounds incorrectly wrapping around when remaining audio data is less then buffer size.

	* Added a OgreOggSoundManager::setForceMutex() function for switching between asynchronous sound actions & blocking sound actions (multi-threaded version ONLY - Useful for ensuring an action has completed before moving on, synching sound to animations??)
		* Added per-call setting of this attribute if necessary for the following functions:
			* createSound()
			* play()
			* stop()
			* pause()

* version 1.19

	* Added patch from torrque to add mingw support.
	
	* Added getPlayPosition() function to OgreOggISound

	* Moved streaming loop callback to a more acurate trigger point

	* Moved #define of HAVE_EFX into windows build only
		* Previously caused build issues on linux/mac where that support wasn't available, by default its disabled everywhere but windows.

	* Fixed mutex locking? 
		* Added a lock to the update function which seems to correctly lock synchronisation between main thread and worker thread.
		* Solves a crash where quitting app whilst loading a sound would casue a crash, it would appear the locking wasn't working correctly,
		* fixed by adding a lock to the updateThread() function, but was under the impression this was unnecessary :s
		* Any performance issues please let me know!

		* Fixes bugs where sound actions were getting cued up in the wrong order.
		* Fixes things like no sound playing after a call to stopAllSounds() then play().

	* Fixed some plugin loopholes as identified by cycheng here: http://www.ogre3d.org/addonforums/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=13383&p=75145#p75145

	* Added a createListener() function for cases where clearScene() is used to destroy all objects
		* This call will destroy all sounds and listener object and there was no way of recreating a listener previously.

	* Added SoundListener for notification of sound events per sound.

		* notifications are: Loaded/Played/Stopped/Paused/Destroyed/Looping

* version 1.07

	* Cleaned out some unused ogg file pointers

	* Added missing subclass call in _notifyMoved() methods of OgreOggIsound/Listener classes
	
	* Added closing/opening of ogg file in stop() when using non-seekable ogg's, should reset play cursor to beginning, however will cause delay whilst re-opening file..



* version 1.06

	* Added check in _reactivateSounds() for stopped sounds.
		* Now if a sound has been stopped whilst waiting for reactivation, it is merely kicked off the list and management is
		  handed back to user.
	
	* Added seeking to sounds in seconds.
		* You can now 'jump' to a point in time (seconds) on any sound, offset is wrapped if out of bounds.
	
	* Added OgreOggISound::getAudioLength() - returns length in seconds.
	
	* Changed default return value from isStopped() to true.
		* Previously if sound didn't have a source it skipped the check and returned false, obviously if it doesn't have a 
		source it can't be playing!
	
	* Changed default return value of isPlaying().
		* Previously if sound didn't have a source it returned false, however, although it isn't currently playing this could
		be due to being held in the reactivate list where it would be restarted when within range, therefore this function now
		returns the current and/or intended status.
	
	* Added functions to record and recover audio position when relinquishing/reactivating.
	
	* Added queues to handle delayed sound actions when compiled with Thread support.
		* Fixes the issue where creating a sound and calling its play/pause/stop functions directly has no effect.
		* It was because the sounds weren't rechecked if the call was made prior to the file having been opened by the second thread. Now such actions are queued and checked by the SoundManager to ensure they are excuted at the earliest opportunity.
	
	* Added mutex locking to sound objects to prevent crashing if calling OgreOggISound functions directly.
	
	* Rebuilt ogg/vorbis libs to remove warnings

	* Added vc8 and vc9 project/solution files

* version 1.05

	* Started porting to linux by wrapping unsupported code in #ifndef LINUX 
		* builds using CMake on LINUX	

	* Removed references to windows specific code

	* Added buffer sharing for static sounds

* version 1.0

	* Official stable release 

* version 0.94

	* Added OGRE plugin support
		* library can be registered with OGRE as a plugin allowing the creation/management of sounds
		  via the SceneManager::createMovableObject() interface. OGRE automatically creates/destroys
		  the manager and all sounds created via this process.
		  NOTE:- The library still functions the same as before if you don't load via the plugin interface.

		  complete, useful when fading out to stop/pause a sound to save cpu time.
		  default: NONE.

	* Fixed crash at maximum sources.

* version 0.92

	* Added support for RIFF WAVE audio files.

	* Fixed unqueue bug in streamed sounds

		not streaming buffers.

	* Cleaned up and enhanced supported features checks.

* version 0.87

	* Added loop callback triggers
