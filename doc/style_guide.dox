\page Code Style Guide

To maintain a consistent coding style, contributors should follow the rules 
outlined on this page. This style guide is separated into four parts: common 
rules, rules specific for C++, rules specific for Lua and guidelines for
using git.

The style rules are intended to increase readability of the source code. The 
most important rule of all is: **Use common sense**. If you have to break 
some rules to make the code more readable (and not just for you, but for 
everyone who has to read your code), break it.

\section common_style Common (Both C++ and Lua)

- Indentation is 4 spaces

- Names (that includes variables, functions and classes) should be descriptive.
  Avoid abbreviations. Do not shorten variable names just to save key strokes, 
  it will be read far more often than it will be written.

- Variables and functions are camelCase with leading lower case. Classes are 
  CamelCase with leading upper case. Constants are CONSTANT_CASE with 
  underscores.

- Filenames are lower_case with underscores. The reason for this is that Thrive
  is a cross-platform project and some platforms use case-sensitive file systems
  (Unix) while others use case-insensitive file systems (Windows). Exceptions 
  are the CMakeLists.txt files, which need to be named like this for CMake to
  find them.

\section cpp_style C++

- Macros are CONSTANT_CASE

- Header files end in .h, source files in .cpp

- Header files should begin with <tt>#pragma once</tt>. Old-style header 
  guards (with \p ifdef) are discouraged because they are very verbose and
  the pragma is understood by all relevant compilers.

- Opening braces go in the same line as the control statement, closing braces
  are aligned below the first character of the opening control statement

- Keep header files minimal. Ideally, they show only functions / classes that
  are useful to other code. All internal helper functions / classes should be
  declared and defined in the source file.

- All classes and their public and protected members should be documented by
  doxygen comments in the header file. If the function's purpose is clear 
  from the name and its parameters (which should be the usual case), the 
  comment can be very basic and only serves to shut up doxygen warnings about
  undocumented stuff.

- Inline comments inside functions can and should be used to describe why
  you wrote the function like this (and, sometimes more importantly, why you
  didn't go another way).

- Member variables of classes are prefixed with \p m_. This is to 
  differentiate them from local or global variables when using their 
  unqualified name (without \p this->) inside member functions. The prefix can
  be omitted for very simple structs if they don't have member functions and
  serve only as data container.

- When calling member functions from another member function, their names are
  qualified with `this->` to differentiate them from global non-member 
  functions.

- Function signatures are formatted like this:
  \code{.cpp}
    [virtual] ReturnType
    functionName(
        ArgType1 arg1,
        ArgType2 arg2
    ) [const] [override] {
        // Function body
    }
  \endcode
  This format may look strange at first, but it has some advantages over 
  other formats. The return type is clearly separated from the function name, 
  which increases readability for long, unwieldy return types (think nested 
  templates). Each argument is at its own line, making it possible to discern 
  the number of arguments and their types at a glance. Again, this increases
  readability for complex argument types.

- For non-trivial classes, use the pimpl idiom to hide implementation details.
  \code{.hpp}
    // In the header:
    #include <memory> // Include for std::unique_ptr

    class MyClass {
        // ...

    public:

        // Constructor required, doesn't need to be
        // default constructor, though
        MyClass();

        // Destructor required.
        ~MyClass();

    private:
      
        struct Implementation;
        std::unique_ptr<Implementation> m_impl;
    };
  \endcode
  \code{.cpp}
    // In the source file:

    struct MyClass::Implementation {
        // Private stuff here
    };

    MyClass::MyClass()
      : m_impl(new Implementation()) // Initialize pimpl
    {
    }

    MyClass::~MyClass() {} // Define destructor
  \endcode

- Prefer C++11's \p using over \p typedef. With the \p using keyword, type 
  aliases look more like familiar variable assignment, with no ambiguity as
  to which is the newly defined type name.

- Virtual member functions overridden in derived classes are marked with the 
  C++11 \p override keyword. This will (correctly) cause a compile time error 
  when the function signature in the base class changes and the programmer 
  forgot to update the derived class.

- Classes not intended as base classes are marked with the \p final keyword
  like this:
  \code{.cpp}
    class MyClass final {
        // ...
    };
  \endcode

- Try to avoid include statements inside header files unless absolutely 
  necessary. Prefer forward declarations and put the include inside the
  source file instead.

- Header includes should be sorted alphabetically (ignoring case)

- Functions and data members inside classes should be sorted alphabetically,
  unless this interfers with destruction order.


\section lua_style Lua

- A class's public data members are *not* prefixed by \p m_, unlike C++. This 
  is because in Lua, all member variables are accessed with their qualified
  names (like <tt>self.memberVariable</tt>), so there is no need to mark them.

- A class's private data members and functions are prefixed with an 
  underscore. This is a convention adopted from Python's PEP8 style guide.

- Doxygen does not support Lua natively, but for consistency's sake, Lua 
  classes and functions are still documented with doxygen style comments.


\section git_style Git

- Do not work in the master branch, always create a private feature branch
  if you want to edit something

- If you are working on a GitHub issue, your feature branch's name should
  begin with the issue number, followed by an underscore, followed by a
  short, descriptive name in lower_case_with_underscores. The name should
  be short, but descriptive enough that you know what the feature branch is
  about without looking up the GitHub ticket.

- Commit early and frequently, even if the code doesn't run or even compile.
  I recommend git-cola (available for all major platforms) as a tool for
  composing good commits. It lets you stage files linewise in a convenient
  interface. So even if you have unrelated changes within the same file,
  you can still separate them.

- When the master branch is updated, you should usually keep your feature
  branch as-is. If you really need the new features from master, do a merge.

- When a feature branch is done, open a pull request on GitHub so that others
  can review it. Chances are that during this review, there will still be
  issues to be resolved before the branch can be merged into master.

- To keep master's commit history clean, your commits in the feature branch
  will have to be "squashed" into one single (or at least very few) commit.
  It must also be rebased onto master if the master branch had any other
  changes since your branch was created. To do so, use an interactive rebase,
  and edit the commit message of the first feature commit, then squashing all
  subsequent commits into that first one.
  It is a good idea to keep the other commit messages inside the new commit's
  message for future reference.

- For maintainers: GitHub requires a merge commit to recognize the merging
  of a pull request. A "git merge --squash" does not create a merge commit and
  will leave the pull request's branch "dangling". To make GitHub properly
  reflect the merge, follow the procedure outlined in the previous bullet
  point, then click the "Merge Pull Request" button on GitHub (or do a 
  normal "git merge".
