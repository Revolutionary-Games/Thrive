Prerequisites
=============

NOTE: since the move to Godot the setup process has changed a lot and
these instructions are not as battle tested as before, so if you have
issues please don't hesitate to bring them up.


Godot mono version
------------------

The currently used Godot version is __3.2.2 mono__. The regular version
will not work. You can download Godot here: https://godotengine.org/download/
if it is still the latest stable version. If a new version of Godot has
been released but Thrive has not been updated yet, you need to look
through the [previous Godot
versions](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/) to get the
right version.


Git with LFS
------------

To clone the Thrive repository properly you need Git with Git LFS.

You need at least Git LFS version 2.8.0, old versions do not work.

On Linux and mac use your package manager to install git. Git lfs is
likely available as a package named `git-lfs`. If it is not install it
manually. After installing remember to run `git lfs install` in terminal.

On Windows install Git with the official installer from:
https://git-scm.com/download/win You can use this installer to also
install git lfs for you. After installing you need to run `git lfs install`
in command prompt. You'll also need to turn autocrlf on with the command
`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

If you previously had Git installed through cygwin, you must uninstall
that and install the official Windows version of Git. You may also
have to deleted all your cloned folders to avoid errors, and reboot
your computer to have everything detect that Git is now in a different
place.

If you haven't used git before you can read a free online book to learn
it here https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 or if you prefer video learning
these two are recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4 


A development environment
-------------------------

You need a supported development environment for Godot with
mono. Note: it is possible to get by with just C# build tools, but
installing a development environment is the easier route.

Godot currently supports the following development environments:

- Visual Studio 2019
- Visual Studio Code
- MonoDevelop
- Visual Studio for Mac
- JetBrains Rider

### MonoDevelop

On Linux MonoDevelop is recommended. To get an up to date version,
first enable the mono repository:
https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ and then install the
following packages with your package manager: `mono-complete
monodevelop nuget`. Make sure it is a newer version of mono that comes
with msbuild. Fedora has mono in the official repo but it is too old
to work.

On Windows don't intall Mono or MonoDevelop, it will break things.

For a better experience with Godot, you can install the following
addon for MonoDevelop:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-monodevelop-addin This is not
needed for basic usage, so you can skip if you can't figure out how to
install it.

### Visual Studio 2019

On Windows you can use Visual Studio 2019 to work on Thrive. You can
find download and setup instructions here https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#configuring-vs-2019-for-debugging

### Visual Studio Code

Note: Setting up Visual Studio Code with Linux is possible,
however it is recommended to use MonoDevelop instead

Visual Studio Code, not to be confused with Visual Studio,
doesn't come with build tools, so you'll need to install 
the build tools for Visual Studio from here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools
During the installation process, make sure MSBuild tools is listed under
the installation details.

Go to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download Under the .NET Core
section, click on _Download .NET Core SDK_ and run the installer.
Go back to the main download page and find
_All .NET Framework Downloads_ Choose version 4.7 and select the Developer Pack.

Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions tab. Get the extensions
_C#_, _Mono Debug_, and _godot-tools_.

Open up a Project in Godot. On the top toolbar, go to Editor -> Editor Settings.
Scroll down on the left window until  you find Mono. Click on Editor and set
External Editor to Visual Studio Code. Click on Builds and set Build Tool to
MSBuild (VS Build Tools).

If you want to setup live debugging with Godot follow the instructions here
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#configuring-visual-studio-code-for-debugging


Building Thrive
===============

After downloading all the prerequisites you can now build Thrive.

Clone
-----

If you plan on contributing to Thrive fork it on github so you
have your own repository to work with. There is an in-depth guide
for working with forks
[here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

Next, use git clone to copy your fork to your computer. If you're setting
up Thrive just for testing or because you want to try in development
features you don't need to fork the project, and can clone the main
Thrive repository.

Note: a path with spaces in it MAY NOT WORK, so to avoid issues you
should clone to a folder like `~/projects` or `C:/projects`. Also, long
paths may cause issues on Windows. One additional potential problem is
non-English characters in the path name, for example if your path
includes "työpöytä", the setup will fail.

You should check at this point if
the image files in `Thrive/assets/textures` can be opened, if they
can't be opened and their file sizes are tiny, you don't have Git LFS
properly installed.

For devs working directly with the Thrive repository switch to a feature
branch or create one when working on new features. For example `git checkout godot`.
This keeps the main branch clean as other branches can be merged through
pull requests on github which is the recommended way to get your code into
Thrive.

Setup
-----

### Project import

Now open your installed Godot with mono. It should open with a project
manager window. From this window select the option to import a
project. Use that option and input the path to the folder you cloned
Thrive in and import the project.godot file.

Now you should see Thrive on the list of projects, double click it to
open it.

Now you should let the Godot editor sit for some time until it is done
checking and importing all the assets. If the asset import fails it is
probably because you didn't have Git LFS installed properly. If that
happens delete the Thrive folder you cloned and go back to the Git LFS
install step, after doing it again try cloning again.

At this point you might want to go through the Godot editor settings
and select the development environment you installed as your external
code editor.

### C# packages

Thrive uses some external C# packages which need to be restored before
compiling.

On Linux, or if you're using Visual Studio Code, open a terminal to
the thrive folder and run the following
command: `nuget restore` it should download the missing nuget
packages. You may need to rerun this command when new package
dependencies are added to Thrive. Note: if you use MonoDevelop it
*might* automatically restore missing packages using nuget when
compiling the game within MonoDevelop. 


On Windows you should use Visual Studio to restore the packages. To do
this open `Thrive.sln` in the Thrive folder. The package restore might
automatically happen if you compile the solution. If it doesn't please
refer to this page on how to restore the nuget packages with Visual
Studio:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore

If you have nuget in path or you use the Visual Studio command prompt
you should also be able to restore the packages by running `nuget
restore` in the Thrive folder.

Note: dotnet restore command should be avoided as it can break things.

Compiling
---------

Now you should be able to return to the Godot editor and hit the build
button in the top right corner. If that succeeds then you should be
good to go.

You can also compile from your development
environment (and not the Godot editor) to see warnings and get
highlighting of errors in the source code. However running the game
from Visual Studio is a bit complicated.

From MonoDevelop you can use the plugin mentioned before, that adds a
toolbar with a button to launch the game. To do that open `Thrive.sln`
with MonoDevelop and in the new toolbar select the options `Thrive -
Launch` and `Tools` then you can hit the play button to the left of
the dropdown options. This should compile and start Thrive so that
breakpoints set in MonoDevelop work.

Done
----

If the build in Godot editor succeeded, you should be now good to go.

You can run the game by pressing the play button in the top right of
the Godot editor or by pressing F5. Additionally if you open different
scenes in the editor you can directly run the current scene to skip
the main menu.

If it didn't work you can try these:

- Thrive community forums
- Thrive developer forums
- Thrive community discord
- Thrive developer discord (you can only access this if you are a team member)

to get help. Links to the forums and community discord
are at the top of this document.

Git LFS limitations
-------------------

Due to current [Git LFS server](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/ThriveDevCenter)
limitations you can't commit changes to files tracked by Git LFS if
you are not a team member. If that is needed for a PR please ask some
team member to commit the assets for you.

For information on committing to the LFS repository you can read this
wiki page https://wiki.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/wiki/Git_LFS 

Optional downloads
------------------

### Ruby

Ruby is needed for the scripts to package the game, and for the
code style checks. So while it is not necessary to download this
it is highly recommended.

On Linux and mac you probably already have this, but if not, use a
package manager to install it.

On windows it is recommended to use RubyInstaller, version 2.4 or
newer, when installing make sure to also install the MSYS option in
order to be able to install gems.

After installing ruby open a terminal / command prompt and run:

```sh
gem install os colorize rubyzip json sha3 httparty parallel nokogiri
```

On Linux you might need to run the command with `sudo`.


If you have trouble installing sha3 on windows: make sure you have
ruby 2.4 or newer installed with ruby installer for windows. Then run
`ridk install` and try all of the options. The third option at least
should reinstall all the ruby development tools, including gmp, which
is needed for sha3. After that your ruby native extension build tools
should be installed and the gem installation should work.

If it still doesn't work run `ridk exec pacman -S gmp-devel` and then
run `ridk install` again.


### 7zip

7zip is needed for the game release script, so if you're not packaging
the game for release you don't need this.

On Linux and mac, use your package manager to install, it is probably
named `p7zip`.

On Windows download the [official](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
installer release. After installing, add the installed folder (where
`7z.exe` is) to PATH environment variable. Confirm by running `7z.exe`
in command prompt or powershell, it should print 7zip version info and
command line usage.


Linter
------

Thrive uses automatic formatting of source code to keep style as
consistent as possible. It is highly recommended you install
this linter to check your code formatting before submitting a 
pull request.

## NodeJS
First install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you are on
Linux you should use your OS's package manager to install nodejs.

After installing nodejs install the linter packages with this command:
```sh
npm install -g jsonlint
```

if that doesn't work run:
```sh
sudo npm install -g jsonlint
```

## Jetbrains tools

Download from: https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/#section=commandline
unzip and add to PATH.

NOTE: there is more documentation on the install process here:
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/InspectCode.html

## Running the Format Checks
When you are getting ready to commit you should run `ruby
check_formatting.rb` in order to automatically run all of the
formatting tools. Make sure that that script doesn't report any errors
before committing.

Pre-commit hook
---------------

On Linux you can enable a pre-commit hook to automatically run the
formatting checks before each commit to avoid accidentally committing
code with formatting issues. To install the hook run the following
script:

```sh
./install_git_hooks.rb
```
