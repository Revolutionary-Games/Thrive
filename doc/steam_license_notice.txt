The Steam release of Thrive may contain LICENSE.txt file at the root
of the game data archive(s) or the game's folder. This file is
included as it includes licensing information of the libraries used by
Thrive, which is used when the effective license text is shown by the
game program. However, the licensing terms for Thrive contained in that
