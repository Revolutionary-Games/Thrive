Learning Godot
==============

Godot is the open source game engine that Thrive is built with.
Godot resources, such as .tscn files, need to be modified
in its editor.

If you have never worked with Godot before it is recommended you
start with the official documentation, specifically the [step by step
section](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
which goes over the basics of how the engine works. Additionally you
should look at the [C# scripting section](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html)
since that is the language used by Thrive.

The [Class Reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html)
is a resource that should be used often by programmers, it contains information
on all of the properties, methods and signals of each of Godot's nodes. By using
an IDE that works well with Godot you can see the class reference directly in the
IDE while coding.

If you learn better with videos [GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest/videos)
is a well known and high quality Godot tutorial channel. In addition there
are many other channels on youtube, just search for the feature you want to
know more about.
